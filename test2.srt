1
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,640
Police.

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
It's my partner.
We had an argument

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,960
and he has just driven off,
but he has been drinking

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,840
and he really shouldn't
be behind the wheel.

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm worried about him.

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,720
ENGINE ROARS

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,560
TYRES SCREECH

8
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,200
Police.

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,920
Yes, I called earlier
and they gave me this number,

10
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,640
but I haven't heard anything.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
Arthur Donalan.

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Yes, you already said that
someone would call me back,

13
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,480
but no-one has!

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Look, he's not
answering his phone,

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,920
and I am very worried about him.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Well...

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,520
..for God's sake, just make
sure that someone does!

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
CLOCK CHIMES THE HOUR

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,600
SHE GASPS

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,600
Down by a rolling river

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,720
chanced to stray

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,040
Her eyes were brown

23
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,680
without a frown

24
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Martha?

25
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,960
In here.  Here, look what I found.
HE CHUCKLES

26
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,560
I must have brought them
with me from the Met.

27
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,000
Forgot all about them.

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,840
I should take them back to
the station, really, shouldn't I?

29
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,960
Or, you know, we could,
er, keep them for a while

30
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
for, erm...

31
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,000
..sexy time!
SHE LAUGHS

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,760
Sounds lovely.

33
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,840
They're rather restrictive,
I imagine.

34
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm dropping off some stuff
at the charity shop first, Motty,

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,200
but I can come
and help you after that.

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,640
Oh, great. The removal men are
bringing the last load over

37
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
in about an hour.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll be as quick as I can.
And, please...

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,360
..don't ever say "sexy time"
in my presence again.

40
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Can we do this tomorrow?
I've got a new cafe to open.

41
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,800
SHE CHUCKLES

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,720
HE SIGHS
That was embarrassing.

43
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,960
she said

44
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,480
The way we come to be

45
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,600
Yeah, it's a big old world indeed

46
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,400
And everyone conspires

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,640
Where all light comes in

48
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
Mrs Palmer?

49
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,560
Morning.  Morning.

50
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,720
If you could pop that...
How's it going?

51
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh! Well, that depends.

52
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,240
If you like to be surrounded
by boxes and not know

53
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
where anything is whilst
being pecked to death

54
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,360
by a flock of seagulls,
it's going great.

55
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,960
Mm! I thought the Inspector
would be here helping.

56
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
He offered, but...

57
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,480
..things tend to take a little
longer when he helps,

58
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
so I said he'd be better at work.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Mm. I feel your pain.

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
I thought it was a college day.

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,200
I switched so I can help Martha
with the move.

62
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't mind, do you?
She's a life-saver.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,040
No, as long as she doesn't
fall behind with her work.

64
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Is that why you're here?
Checking up on me?

65
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,560
No. I was hoping I'd get a coffee.

66
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,160
Well, that's not happening.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
I don't even know where the coffee
machine is,

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,320
let alone where to plug it in,
never mind coffee beans or milk.

69
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
Not a problem.
I'll leave you to it.

70
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,240
And if you want a full day's
work out of madam here,

71
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,920
you might need to
take her phone off her.

72
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,160
You know, I read this thing
last week about a girl in the US

73
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,680
who divorced her parents.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,320
I'll sue you for maintenance.
PHONE RINGS

75
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,440
Have fun.

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Sergeant Williams.

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Where?

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
Yeah. Yeah, that one.
OK. On my way.

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,160
Oh, erm, you know,
lots of reasons, really.

80
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,680
Erm, well, it's in the heart
of town, you know,

81
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,240
which is, erm...which
is...which is good.

82
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,480
And, erm, the landlord
of the last place

83
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,080
was a right pain in the backside.
SHE CHUCKLES

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,040
And I did offer to help with
the move, you know, but, erm,

85
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Martha insisted that
I came to work instead.

86
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Ah!

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm sure she knows best.

88
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,720
I'll get maintenance
to take a look.

89
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
We've got maintenance?
